## About the Program

In the Monte Carlo Methods Program, we explore the fascinating world of Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Monte Carlo methods are powerful computational techniques used to approximate solutions to complex mathematical and statistical problems through random sampling. This program aims to provide you with hands-on examples and explanations of various Monte Carlo methods, their applications, and how to implement them using code.

## Contents

This repository is organized into various sections, each corresponding to different Monte Carlo methods discussed in the program. You will find code samples, notebooks, and other resources related to the methods demonstrated in the videos. Feel free to explore the folders and files to learn and experiment with the concepts covered.
